        <p class="lead mb-4">Bojack Horseman has been building up to the last episodes of the series all along. This is especially evident in episode fifteen of season six, ‚ÄúThat Sinking Feeling‚Äù, which is the series‚Äô penultimate episode. ‚ÄúThat Sinking Feeling‚Äù is about the death of Bojack Horseman and how he is processing his life and death. Throughout the series Bojack continuously makes bad decisions putting his career and life at risk. One day all of his bad habits and decisions were bound to catch up with him. Although the introduction credits changed throughout the seasons it always ended with Bojack falling to the bottom of his swimming pool.
	Terrible decisions Bojack has made has led to his friends separating themselves from him. The episode starts with Bojack greeting his mother and giving her plants with Sarah Lynn. The opening of this episode leaves the audience a little confused as what is going on in the beginning is obscured. The people within the mansion are all people that were a part of Bojack‚Äôs life but that also have all passed. Bojack is surrounded by characters within the story like Corduroy Jackson-Jackson, Herb Kazzaz, and Crackerjack Sugarman. With no complete certainty of what is happening one thing is clear by his surroundings, it is that Bojack himself is dying.
	Bojack Horseman is no stranger to drug trips or hallucinations and dream sequences, but ‚ÄúThe View from Halfway Down‚Äù is not the same as those past episodes. There is more weight to this episode and a trapped feeling. We get this feeling of being trapped in with death. This inescapable feeling of death is intensified when Bojack realizes he is currently drowning in his former swimming pool, passed out, and unable to wake back up. The only thing Bojack is able to do is watch his dead family and friends waiting to join them in death.
	An important fact about the episode before going into the plot of ‚ÄúThe View from Halfway Down,‚Äù is that everything in this episode is happening inside of Bojack‚Äôs mind. What is happening in Bojack‚Äôs mind is his brain sorting out what the meaning of life is before the end of his own life. The end of life is portrayed as this black tar that is shown at the beginning of the episode dripping from the ceiling and then slowly dripping onto Bojack himself.
	Once inside the house Bojack is seated with his family and friends around a dinner table and served by Zach Braff, also dead within Bojack. There is a conversation amongst the table of the best part, worst part of their life. They discuss their best parts and worst parts of their life while being served their meal which was the last thing they each had before they died, for example Bojack was served drugs. The black tar leak continues to get worse and drip onto Bojack‚Äôs head. The table has a deep philosophical conversation of whether their death was meaningful and if death can be meaningful. Corduroy Jackson Jackson regrets his hedonistic death and sees it as meaningless. Corduroy would rather have died doing something meaningful like how Crackerjack died while fighting in the war. However, Crackerjack states that he did nothing good during the war and was actually accidently killed by friendly fire. Then Sarah Lynn discusses how she had a terrible life that had meaning from having others get pleasure from watching her life. Then Herb Kazzaz says what gave his life meaning was the philanthropy work that he did.<br><br>
